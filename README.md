Rock, Paper, Scissors - Game Description
Overview: Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand game played between two players—typically used as a decision-making tool or for fun. In this C++ implementation, the game is played against a computer opponent, with a best-of-three format to determine the winner.

How It Works:
The player chooses one of three options:
Rock (1)
Paper (2)
Scissors (3)

The computer randomly picks one of the three options.

The game compares the choices using standard rules:

Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beat Paper

Paper beats Rock

If both choices are the same, it’s a tie.

The first player to win two rounds wins the game.
